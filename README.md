# Azul3D - audio #
This package provides a generic audio package for Go. It is very similar to Go's image package, except for audio.

# Version 2 #
* Documentation
  * [azul3d.org/audio.v2](http://azul3d.org/audio.v2)
  * `import "azul3d.org/audio.v2"`
* Changes
  * Single-sample types were replaced by their direct Go type (see [#6](https://github.com/azul3d/audio/issues/6)):
    * `PCM8  -> uint8`
    * `PCM16 -> int16`
    * `PCM32 -> int32`
    * `ALaw  -> uint8`
    * `MuLaw -> uint8`
  * Slices of samples types were renamed (see [#6](https://github.com/azul3d/audio/issues/6)):
    * `PCM8         -> type Uint8 []uint8`
    * `PCM16        -> type Int16 []int16`
    * `PCM32        -> type Int32 []int32`
    * `ALaw         -> type ALaw []uint8`
    * `MuLawSamples -> type MuLaw []uint8`
  * Conversion functions were renamed (see [#6](https://github.com/azul3d/audio/issues/6)):
    * `ALawToPCM16  -> ALawToInt16`
    * `F64ToPCM16   -> Float64ToInt16`
    * `F64ToPCM32   -> Float64ToInt32`
    * `F64ToPCM8    -> Float64ToUint8`
    * `PCM16ToALaw  -> Int16ToALaw`
    * `PCM16ToF64   -> Int16ToFloat64`
    * `PCM16ToMuLaw -> Int16ToMuLaw`
    * `PCM32ToF64   -> Int32ToFloat64`
    * `MuLawToPCM16 -> MuLawToInt16`
    * `PCM8ToF64    -> Uint8ToFloat64`
